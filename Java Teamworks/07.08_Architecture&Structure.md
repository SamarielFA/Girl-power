2. Why is there needed some kind of structure and architecture
3. Find other architecture types, figure out pros and cons



### "Clean architecture" is a software design philosophy that promotes separation of concerns, aiming for a system that is modular, maintainable, and testable. It organizes code into layers, ensuring that business logic is independent of frameworks and external dependencies.


### 1. The separate parts are organized into layers. Each layer has a specific role, and they communicate with each other in a controlled way. This layering helps keep the system organized and makes it easier to manage changes.

### 2. Having a structure and architecture in software development is important for several reasons:

- Maintainability: A well-structured system is easier to understand, debug, and modify. When the code is organized, developers can quickly locate and fix issues or add new features.

- Scalability: Good architecture allows a system to grow and adapt to increasing demands without becoming overly complex or inefficient.

- Reusability: Proper structure enables parts of the code to be reused in different parts of the application or in different projects, saving time and effort.

- Testability: Structured code is easier to test. Each part can be tested independently, ensuring that changes in one area do not unexpectedly affect others.

- Collaboration: Clear architecture makes it easier for multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without stepping on each other’s toes.

- Consistency: A consistent structure provides a common understanding for all developers, reducing confusion and errors.

- Flexibility: Good architecture allows for changes in technology, requirements, or design without a complete overhaul of the system.

# 3. Architecture types in  real- life examples:

## 1. Monolithic Architecture 
-Simple applications, small teams, straightforward deployment.
-Pros: Simple to develop, deploy, and scale initially.
-Cons: Hard to maintain and scale as the application grows.

- WordPress REST API;
- eBay API: 
   Initially developed as a monolithic application, eBay’s API allowed for comprehensive access to their marketplace, including listing, buying, and bidding functionalities;
 
- Facebook Graph API (early versions): 
    Before transitioning to a more service-oriented approach, Facebook’s Graph API was monolithic, handling various features like user data, social connections, and interactions in a single system;
- JIRA REST API;  
- SAP ERP API.

## 2. Layered (N-Tier) Architecture
Divides the application into logical layers, such as presentation, business logic, and data access.
-Enterprise applications, systems requiring clear separation of concerns.
-Pros: Organized, easy to manage, and test each layer.
-Cons: Can become complex and harder to manage with many layers.

- Pedometer: A typical pedometer app often uses a layered architecture, where the core layers manage sensor data (like step counting), business logic (calculating distance or calories), and the presentation layer (displaying the information to the user).
  
- Salesforce API: Enables integration with Salesforce’s CRM platform, allowing businesses to manage customer data, automate sales processes, and create custom apps on top of Salesforce’s infrastructure;
  
- Zillow API: Offers access to real estate data such as property listings, home valuations, and local market trends, used by developers to create real estate apps and tools;

- Microsoft Graph API: Provides access to various Microsoft 365 services like Outlook, OneDrive, and Teams, with clear layers for handling data access, business logic, and user interface;
- Google Maps API;
- SAP S/4HANA API: Allows access to SAP’s next-generation business suite, with layered architecture separating the core business logic from presentation and data layers.
  
## 3. Microservices Architecture 
-Breaks down the application into small, independent services that communicate over a network.
-Large, complex applications, need for scalability and flexibility.
-Pros: Scalable, flexible, each service can use different technologies.
Cons: Complex to manage, requires robust network communication.

- Netflix API;
- LinkedIn; 
- Uber API;
- Spotify API; 
- Airbnb API.
- YouTube : architecture allows  to manage its vast platform, which includes video streaming, content recommendation, user management, and ad services.Each component is developed and scaled independently, enabling YouTube to handle massive traffic and data;
- Messenger(Facebook Messenger).
  
## 4. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
-Similar to microservices but typically involves larger, more coarse-grained services.
-Enterprise environments, integration of heterogeneous systems.
-Pros: Reusability, scalability, and integration capabilities.
Cons: Complexity, can be heavy and require significant infrastructure.

- PayPal API
- Swedbank ,  Luminor Bank App`s;
- Amazon MWS (Marketplace Web Service): Helps Amazon sellers manage their online stores by providing access to inventory, order processing, customer communications, and reporting.
- Oracle E-Business Suite API;
- IBM WebSphere API;
- SAP PI (Process Integration) API.
  
## 5. Event-Driven Architecture
-Uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services or components.
-Real-time systems, applications with asynchronous processing needs.
Pros: Scalability, responsiveness, and decoupling.
Cons: Complexity in handling and managing events, potential for inconsistency.

- Waze
- Stripe API
- Slack API
- GitHub Webhooks: Allows developers to receive real-time notifications of events like push commits, issue updates, and pull requests, enabling event-driven automation;
- Microsoft Azure Event Grid.
  
## 6. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
-Separates the core business logic from external concerns like user interfaces and databases.
-Applications requiring high testability and maintainability.
-Pros: Flexibility, testability, clear separation of concerns.
-Cons: Initial complexity, requires discipline to maintain.

- Shopify API
- Allegro API: Powers Poland’s leading e-commerce platform by allowing sellers to manage listings, orders, and user interactions, while maintaining flexibility through integration with external tools and services;
- Magento API: Provides access to Magento’s e-commerce platform;
- Drupal API 

## 7. Serverless Architecture
-Relies on cloud services to manage server infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on code.
-Applications with variable workloads, rapid development needs.
-Pros: Reduced operational overhead, automatic scaling.
Cons: Dependency on cloud provider, limited control over infrastructure.

- AWS Lambda-backed APIs (e.g., Amazon Alexa): Allows developers to create and manage voice-controlled skills for Amazon Alexa, using serverless functions that execute in response to voice commands without managing infrastructure;
  
- Twilio Functions: Enables developers to build communication workflows, like sending SMS or making calls, using serverless functions that automatically scale based on usage;
- Firebase Cloud Functions 

## 8. Model-View-Controller (MVC)
-Separates an application into three main components: Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (business logic).
-Web applications, applications requiring clear separation between UI and logic.
-Pros: Organized, separation of concerns, reusable components.
Cons: Can lead to tight coupling between components if not managed carefully.

- GitHub API: Allows developers to interact with GitHub’s platform, managing repositories, commits, issues, and user data, facilitating integration with development tools and workflows.
- Django-based APIs (e.g., Instagram API)
- Laravel API;
- Ruby on Rails API.
