```SQL
# 1. Calculate total Sales by City

SELECT Owners.City, SUM(Procedures.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
JOIN Owners ON Pets.OwnerID = Owners.OwnerID
GROUP BY Owners.City
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;


# 2. Calculate total Sales by Pet Kind

SELECT Pets.Kind, SUM(Procedures.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
GROUP BY Pets.Kind
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;


# 3. Calculate total Sales by City and Pet Kind

SELECT Owners.City, Pets.Kind, SUM(Procedures.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
JOIN Owners ON Pets.OwnerID = Owners.OwnerID
GROUP BY Owners.City, Pets.Kind
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;


# 4. Calculate Average sales by City

SELECT Owners.City, ROUND(AVG(Procedures.Price),2) AS AverageSales
FROM Sales JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
JOIN Owners ON Pets.OwnerID = Owners.OwnerID
GROUP BY Owners.City
ORDER BY AverageSales DESC;

# 5.  Explore Relationships in SQLite

### In SQLite, relationships between tables are typically established using foreign keys.
 A foreign key  is a column(or set of columns) in one table that links to the primary key of another table, creating a relationship between the two.

 A primary key  is a unique identifier for each record in a database table. It ensures that each entry in the table can be uniquely identified.
 -They are crucial for maintaining data integrity and establishing relationships between tables.
 -They allow tables to be linked together through foreign keys, which reference primary keys in other tables.
 

### How it looks within  our Tables:

- Owners: OwnerID (Primary Key),
  
- Pets: PetID (Primary Key),
        OwnerID (Foreign Key)
- Sales: SaleID (Primary Key),
         PetID (Foreign Key),
- Procedures: ProcedureCode (Primary Key),

In the Sales table, PetID is a foreign key because it references the PetID in the Pets table, indicating which pet each sale is associated with.

### How We Know:
1. Table Design and Relationships:

   Pets Table:
PetID is designated as the primary key, meaning it's unique for each pet.
  Sales Table:
PetID is a foreign key that links to the PetID in the Pets table, indicating that each sale record is related to a specific pet.

2. SQL Schema Definition:
  When creating the tables in SQL, you explicitly define which columns are primary keys and which are foreign keys.

 
### Examples of Relationships:
- Owners to Pets: One-to-Many (one owner can have many pets)
- Pets to Sales: One-to-Many (one pet can have many sales records)
- Sales to Procedures: Many-to-One (many sales records can link to one procedure)
