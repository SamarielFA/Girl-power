TEAMWORK: (not really)

Download dbBrowser for sqlite
https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/

Try to open the database that you created in your project (you can see the my.db in files on the left side)

Read about SQL, learn insert, delete, update, select on this page

https://sqliteonline.com/

A lot of resources is here
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp

Create 3 tables with some non-complex data, populate them with values, you will be able to use this database later on, but this is just for you to practise and understand db a bit better.


```SQL
--Stores information about the movies being shown.
CREATE TABLE Movies (
    MovieID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    Title TEXT NOT NULL,
    Genre TEXT,
    Director TEXT,
    Duration INTEGER,  -- Duration in minutes
    ReleaseDate DATE,
    Rating TEXT  -- e.g., G, PG, PG-13, R
);

INSERT INTO Movies (Title, Genre, Director, Duration, ReleaseDate, Rating) VALUES
('Inception', 'Science Fiction', 'Christopher Nolan', 148, '2010-07-16', 'PG-13'),
('The Godfather', 'Crime', 'Francis Ford Coppola', 175, '1972-03-24', 'R'),
('The Dark Knight', 'Action', 'Christopher Nolan', 152, '2008-07-18', 'PG-13'),
