### Teamwork:
Task: This is a complicated topic, teamwork is to look at scikit-learn library together. Suggested questions to discuss:
1. What is an error rate?
2. Where you could use other machine-learning models?
3. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised training?
4. How to import different models from the scikit-learn package?
5. How can you evaluate the performance of a machine learning model in scikit-learn?
6. What metrics are commonly used for evaluation?
7. What is model overfitting, and how can it be prevented?

### 1.What is an error rate?
The error rate is often used to assess how well a model is performing. It is calculated as:

Understanding and calculating error rate helps in improving model performance, diagnosing issues,
and making informed decisions based on the model's effectiveness.

### 3. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised training?
**Unsupervised learning** - we don't have labeled data.
**Supervised learning**- we have labeled data.

In **supervised learning**, the goal is to predict outcomes for new data. You know up front the type of results to expect. With an **unsupervised learning** algorithm, the goal is to get insights from large volumes of new data. The machine learning itself determines what is different or interesting from the data set.

Imagine you have a big box of colorful toy blocks, and you want to learn how to sort them.<br/>
**Supervised Learning**:<br/>
**• Example**: Think of it like having a teacher or a grown-up sitting with you and showing you how to sort the blocks by color.<br/>
**• How it work**s: The teacher gives you examples, like, "This block is red, so it goes in the red pile," and "This block is blue, so it goes in the blue pile." You learn from these examples, and then you can sort the blocks by yourself because you know what to do.<br/>
**Unsupervised Learning:**<br/>
**• Example**: This time, you're sorting the blocks all by yourself, without anyone telling you how to do it.<br/>
**• How it works**: You start grouping the blocks by how they look or feel—maybe you notice that some are big, some are small, some are smooth, and some are rough. You make groups based on what you see, even though no one told you how to do it.<br/>
**The Difference**:<br/>
In **• supervised learning**, you have someone to guide you and show you the right way to sort things.<br/>
In **• unsupervised learning**, you figure out the best way to sort things on your own, by looking for patterns and similarities.<br/>
So, supervised learning is like learning with a helper, and unsupervised learning is like exploring and discovering patterns by yourself!
