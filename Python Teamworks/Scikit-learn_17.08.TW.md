### Teamwork:
Task: This is a complicated topic, teamwork is to look at scikit-learn library together. Suggested questions to discuss:
1. What is an error rate?
2. Where you could use other machine-learning models?
3. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised training?
4. How to import different models from the scikit-learn package?
5. How can you evaluate the performance of a machine learning model in scikit-learn?
6. What metrics are commonly used for evaluation?
7. What is model overfitting, and how can it be prevented?

### 3. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised training?
Unsupervised learning - we don't have labeled data.
Supervised learning - we have labeled data.

In supervised learning, the goal is to predict outcomes for new data. You know up front the type of results to expect. With an unsupervised learning algorithm, the goal is to get insights from large volumes of new data. The machine learning itself determines what is different or interesting from the data set.
